    <h2>Use your perks around the 3rd round, don‚Äôt use them early. Study the board and try to get extra moves. Use your booster every time its available. This game requires some skill and reaction time. The biggest thing is studying the board for moves, make sure to do it even if its the opponents turn.<h2>
  <div class="text-area3">   
    <h2>Games are also timed so you gotta make moves fast. To get extra moves you have to match 4. Basically any pieces that let you match more than 4 or more will give you an extra move, vertical, horizontal, etc. If pieces are both horizontal and vertical together, then it can create a bomb. Matching 5 can also create lightning I recommend to use the hammer perk to break it. Take advantage of this and you can win most of your games.<h2> 
  <div class="text-area4">   
    <h2>Don‚Äôt spend your coins early game. I recommend spending them until you reach around 1k trophies. Spend them on gold boosters when you unlock them. You can get free coins from their facebook page or links. Stickers can help you unlock boosters and get you free coins. Joining a team and requesting boosters is also useful.</h2>
